# AMD OpenNIC Project

The OpenNIC project provides an FPGA-based NIC platform for the open source
community.  It consists of multiple components: a NIC shell, a Linux kernel
driver, and a DPDK driver.  The NIC shell contains the RTL sources and design 
files for targetting several of the AMD-Xilinx Alveo boards featuring UltraScale+ 
FPGAs.  It delivers a NIC implementation supporting up to four PCI-e physical 
functions (PFs) and two 100Gbps Ethernet ports.  The shell is equipped with 
well-defined data and control interfaces and is designed to enable easy 
integration of user logic into the shell.  A block diagram of the OpenNIC 
shell follows:

The Linux kernel driver implements the device driver for the NIC shell. It
supports multiple PFs and multiple TX/RX queues in each PF.  The RX queues are
selected through a receive-side scaling (RSS) implementation in the shell.

The goal of OpenNIC is to enable fast prototyping of hardware-accelerated
network-attached applications.  It is not a fully-fledged SmartNIC solution.

The latest version of OpenNIC is 1.0, which uses OpenNIC shell version 1.0 and
OpenNIC driver version 1.0 or OpenNIC DPDK driver version 1.0.

## Repo Structure

This repository serves as the release point for the OpenNIC project, which
consists of three components:
   - [OpenNIC shell](https://github.com/Xilinx/open-nic-shell.git),
   - [OpenNIC driver](https://github.com/Xilinx/open-nic-driver.git), and
   - [OpenNIC DPDK](https://github.com/Xilinx/open-nic-dpdk.git).

A released version of OpenNIC pins to a commit in the `master` branch of each component repository.

A Bash script `script/checkout.sh` is provided to checkout a specific version of
OpenNIC.  It takes two arguments, the root directory for the cloned repositories
and optionally, a version number.  By default, it will checkout the latest
version.  The correspondence between OpenNIC versions and component repository
tags are tracked in `script/version.yaml`.

## Technical Reference Guide

A technical reference guide ([PDF version](https://github.com/Xilinx/open-nic/blob/main/OpenNIC_manual.pdf)
or [MS Word version](https://github.com/Xilinx/open-nic/blob/main/OpenNIC_manual.docx)) provides details of
the design of the OpenNIC.  The document primarily covers the hardware architecture and its related
implementation.  It also briefly describes the organization of the Linux kernel driver for OpenNIC.

## FAQ
